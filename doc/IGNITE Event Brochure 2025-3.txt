About Event :

The Drone Design Expo is an exciting event of the technical fest, bringing together drone enthusiasts, engineers, and innovators to showcase their cutting-edge drone designs and technologies. This event serves as a platform to showcase the capabilities of drones, antidrone technologies, and unmanned systems across various applications.
Your priority should be hardware but incase you have a idea or software you can showcase that also.

REGISTRATION FEE : 500/-

Rules:

The event is open to all students participating in the technical fest. Participants can register as individuals or as a team (maximum of 4 members per team).
Each team can showcase only one drone design.
The drone can be aerial, underwater, or ground-based.
It can be pre-built or custom-made, but significant modifications must be made to pre-built models.
The drone should be manually or autonomously controlled (AI-based or remote-controlled models allowed).
Use of GPS, sensors, andcameras is permitted but must be disclosed. Participants must adhere to safety guidelines while operating drones. Setup: Teams will be given a time slot to set up and prepare.
Drone Display & Demonstration: Participants will showcase and explain
their designs.	61
Q&A with Judges: Judges may ask about the design, components, and










Evaluation Criteria :

About Event :

"More speed, More power with minimum time"
Design a manually controlled ROBOT that has capacity to cover maximum distance in shortest possible time, challenging the hurdles and be one of the best opponents. Think your robot can overcome any obstacle-big or small in the least of time.

REGISTRATION FEE : 700/-

Methodology:

Round Description:
Round 1:- Elimination round (Time based).
Round 2:- Qualifier (Minimum number of human intervention and time based).
Final round: - Track will be revealed on spot (completion and time based).

Phases in the event:

1) The competition is based on a time trial system. There will be an elimination round for each team.
2) The top team from the qualifier round makes it to the final round on the basis of time trials and based on the minimum number of human contacts with the robot.
3) In the qualifier round, hand touches are allowed with a penalty of 10
seconds. For each hand touch, penalty time will be added further t6o 3
overall time required by robot for completion of specified round.










4) If any of the robots starts off before start up call, the counter would be restated and the machines will get a second chance. If repeated again then team will be disqualified.
5) If robot goes off course of the track, penalty of 5 seconds will be added each time to the overall time attained by robot for round completion.
6) Machine must not contain any readymade kits, pneumatic & hydraulic systems or IC engines.
7) Decision about your robot will be taken by the organizers.

Robot Specifications:
1. The maximum dimension of the robot can be 30 x 30 cm (l x b).
2. The robot may be wired or wireless.
3. The length of the wire (for wired bots) should be long enough to cover the whole track and
4. The wire should remain slack during the complete run.
5. Max weight should be limited by 5 kg.
6. Readymade toy cars are not allowed.

Learning Outcomes:

1. Students will be able to work as a team member.
2. Increased observing, Improved creativity, Analyzing power and Change in the way of thinking.
3. Student will able to know about robot ergonomics and aerodynamic feature of vehicle.
4. Purpose of four wheel drive, rear wheel drive, and front wheel drive.
5. Students learn about steering mechanism.

About Event:
To design and develop the manually controlled robot to defeat the opponent robot in a war within a specific amount of time.
REGISTRATION FEE : 1000/-
Methodology:
Round Description:
Round 1: No weapon round
In this round none of team will be allowed to use weapons.
Round 2: Limited weapon round
 In this round teams are allowed to use weapons for 2 minutes out of 5 minutes.
Round 3: Full weapon round.
In this round team will be allowed to use weapons since beginning. Every team will get three chances (2 chances required to qualify the round) in every round except final round
Phases in the event: A Knockout system
 If your opponent is rendered immobilized irrelevant of the reason being and stays stationary for more than 30 seconds you will win the round.
Time elapse
 1. In the event that the time for the duel has elapsed and both robots are still operational, the following manner will be used to judge the winning robot:
2. The robot that is not able to retract itself automatically in starting position is deemed the looser
3. A decision will be taken on the following grounds: 30% public opinion taken exactly after the draw
 70% assigned by the judges on the basis of Fighting initiative & Technical damage	65
